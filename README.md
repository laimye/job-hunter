Business Casual is a comprehensive online application for tracking your job search. 

If you've submitted more resumes to more places than you can possibly remember, it's time to start keeping a log of where and when you've applied to each job. Business casual allows you to store information about the job you've applied for (including the link to the job description), when you submitted your resume, the version of the resume you submitted, the follow up date, and much more. Besides that, you can dynamically add comments and next steps to stay on organized. 

Business Casual saves your time while putting you in complete control of your career and job search.

## Major Hurdles
I encountered some hurdles during production time with Business Casual in the form of:
> * **MEAN Stack concept** - Understanding how back end is connected to the front end, how they depend and work with each other, and implementing this concept in life.
> * **Custom configuration of Angular's $Resource service** - that is used to perform CRUD on RESTful resources.
> * **CSS styling** - Had some difficulties with hover over effect on thumbnails.

##Unsolved Issues
No known issues at this moment.
